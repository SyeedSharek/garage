Design a modern web dashboard UI with a clean and professional look. The dashboard should include:

1. A collapsible sidebar with navigation links for different modules (Vehicles, Customers, Services, Reports).
2. A top header/navbar that includes a logo, search bar, notifications icon, and user profile menu.
3. A responsive main content area with:
   - Cards showing key metrics (e.g., total vehicles, total customers, active services)
   - Tables for listing items with actions like edit, delete, view
   - Centralized forms that can be reused across the dashboard for creating and editing entities
4. Use a consistent color palette, modern typography, and Material Design principles (Vuetify style)
5. Include interactive UI elements like buttons, modals, dropdowns, and input fields
6. The layout should be modular so components like sidebar, header, navbar, and forms can be reused in different pages
7. Ensure the design is suitable for desktop and tablet screens
8. Provide a clean, visually appealing, and professional look for a Garage Management System dashboard

Output format: UI layout mockup / dashboard design with sidebar, header, navbar, cards, tables, and reusable forms.
